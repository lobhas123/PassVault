                        <p>Our application aims to solve the above problem by creating a one-stop destination for generating, storing, and managing passwords which are unique and secure.

                        <p>In the modern world, we have accounts on multiple platforms which require password authentication. It is difficult to create and remember so many passwords.<br><br>
                        It is always advised that the passwords should be mutually exclusive and unique so the possibility of getting hacked and having our data breached are lesser, considering that some of the information we put out is sensitive and confidential.
